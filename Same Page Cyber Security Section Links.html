 <h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>Cyber Security has become the most essential discipline in the current high technology information systems era as there is always a lot of scope for unauthorized access of information or resources (Technically Hacking), as all these information systems are always not independent and are connected in a public network or private network with every possible vulnerability from malicious attackers out there in the cyber world (a digital network either wired or wireless connected to all PCs, laptops, Mobiles, TABs etc..).
These unethical attackers are called Hackers commonly and any business or organization is vulnerable to these attackers as their main aim is to hack the confidential or sensitive data of these workgroups. Thus there is a necessity for protecting the businesses or organizations from these attacks. Hence a new discipline called Ethical Hacking has come into existence in recent times. The role of Ethical Hacker is to protect the organization or business from cyber attacks. Ethical Hacker is also a hacker but hacks the systems to test the existence of vulnerabilities in the cyber system that exists in an organization. This is where Ethical Hacking connects with Cyber Security in its implementation.
Cyber security includes a lot of security mechanisms like cryptographic and steganographic techniques including various algorithms like DES, AES, Blowfish, MD5, SHA1/2/3, IDEA etc. and LSB, JSteg, F5 Algorithms. Not just these techniques, other securities like Antivirus software, Anti-spywares, Anti-Adware, Firewalls, and Proxies also protect the systems from cyber attacks. 
Cyber Security could be provided in three different ways broadly. These are-
1)	Server Security: This includes protecting servers from cyber attacks. Various servers like database, FTP, HTTP,SMTP, DNS Servers are to be protected from Malicious attacks. Firewall Systems and cryptography or steganography could help in securing servers. Vulnerability scanning, port scanning tools are required for finding the vulnerable openings that become sources for server attacks.
2)	System Security: This includes securing PCs, Laptops or Mobiles from attacks using various antivirus software and firewalls.
3)	Network Security: Another important security system is a secure network without which, it is difficult to imagine cyber security for any cyber system. Efficient Network Firewalls, Intrusion detection systems and Proxy servers, secure IP networks using VPN and other network encryption algorithms like IKE, DES, AH, ESP are all very much essential for providing this type of security.
Cyber security always looks at providing security to the Systems out there in the network from attackers (Hackers or Crackers). Before considering the implementation of Cyber Security, it is important to know the various types of Hackers that exist in the cyber world.

There are mainly three types of Hackers. They are:
1)	White Hats: They are the trustworthy hackers, the moral programmers who utilize their hacking abilities for guarded purposes or for shielding the association from cyber-attacks. White-hat hackers are usually security professionals with knowledge of hacking and the hacker toolset and who utilize this information to find shortcomings and actualize countermeasures. White hats are the individuals who hack with consent from the proprietor of the association or organization. It is essential or obligatory to get authorization before starting any hacking activity. This is what makes a security professional a white hat Hacker as against a Malicious Hacker who doesn’t take any authorization for hacking.

2)	Black Hats: They are the malignant programmers, also called as crackers who utilize their abilities for unlawful or destructive purposes. They break into or generally damage the framework integrity of remote frameworks, with destructive intentions. Having gained unapproved access, black hat programmers mutilate or tamper sensitive information, deny authentic clients service, and just cause troubles for their targets. Black hats and crackers can easily be distinguished from white hats in light of the fact that their activities are unlawful and unrighteous. This is the conventional meaning of a hacker and many individuals see the hackers with this point of view.

3)	Gray Hats: They may sometimes cause harm or some of the time secure the digital frameworks, as per the circumstance. This is where there arises the contrast between hacker and cracker. They are especially intrigued by hacking tools and technologies and are not harmful like black hats. Grey hats show themselves as moral programmers, who are interested in hacker tools for the most part because of an interest in hacking other's vital data. They may want to demonstrate security issues in a framework or advise the victims to secure their frameworks properly. These programmers are helping the victims in an indirect way. For instance, if a shortcoming is found in an administration offered by an investment bank, the programmer is helping the bank by allowing the bank to redress the loopholes in security.

<h3>Terminology in Cyber Security</h3>
<p>
Threat: Breach of security is termed as Threat. Hackers use tools and software that pose threats to a cyber-system. Ethical hackers try to set a priority for detecting these threats based on the amount of loss created by a particular threat.
Exploit: An exploit is the identification of a security bug or loophole in the cyber system that allows the hacker to enter the system to access various kinds of sensitive information. The hacker doesn’t need to be an expert programmer to find the bugs or logical errors that exist in a system as many readymade exploits are already available as tools.
Vulnerability: It is a software bug or logical error or implementation flaw that causes damage or unexpected event to the cyber system. Exploit code is sent by the hacker to cause a fault and retrieve sensitive data.
Target of Evaluation (TOE): TOEs are either a system or a program or even a network subject to attack. Ethical hackers concentrate on High priority TOEs like Account Numbers, Passwords, Social Security numbers and other confidential data. They test the available hacking tools to check these vulnerabilities and provide protection against these exploits.
Attack: An Attack occurs if there is a vulnerability in the System. Ethical Hackers should identify these vulnerabilities and rectify them for avoiding attacks.



Exploits are of two types

Remote: This type of exploit is from an outsider to an organization via public network without any prior privilege to access the cyber systems. Hacker is generally considered to be a remote attacker, but most attacks are from internal hackers (employees/contractors).
Local: This type of exploit is from internal hackers like employees or contractors or other trusted people with malicious intensions. The privileges given to each employee or individual within an organization should be properly monitored to avoid unprivileged access of data or sensitive information.

<h3> Phases in Ethical Hacking </h3>
<p>
There are five phases of Ethical hacking that protects an organization from unwanted attacks.
These are:

 



Phase-1:
Reconnaissance: It is a process of gathering the information and trying to access the resources.
There are two types of Reconnaissance: Active and Passive.
Passive reconnaissance: it involves gathering information about a potential target without notice. This is commonly in the form of searching internet for valuable information about a particular organization or individual. Social Engineering or Dumpster Driving come under this category. Other methods like sniffing the network using various sniffers is also a passive reconnaissance.
Active Reconnaissance: This is a slightly risky operation that involves probing the actual ip-address range, particular host information or even servers information being present in the network indicating the existence of hacker, sometimes leading to suspicion or even tracking the attacker. Active Reconnaissance discovers the OS version, installed software and other network information that is useful for detecting vulnerabilities from the hacker’s point of view.
Phase-2:
Scanning: this phase involves taking the information from phase-1 and identifying vulnerabilities using suitable tools like:
1) Dialers
2) Port Scanners
3) ICMP Scanners
4) Ping Sweeps
5) Network Mappers
6) SNMP Sweepers
7) Vulnerability Scanners

Phase-3:
Gaining Access: This phase is the starting point for real hacking. The loopholes detected in the previous two phases are exploited here for gaining access to the system. This attack is possible now from either a LAN or a public network or sometimes even offline. Some examples of this phase are stack-based buffer overflow, DoS and Session Hijacking.

Phase-4:
Maintaining Access: Once the network access is obtained, the hackers maintain this access for subsequent exploitation or attacks. Hardening process is also employed sometimes to block access to other hackers or even security professionals within the organization by using various backdoor entry tools, rootkits and Trojans. Once the system is under the control of a hacker, he can use it for further attacks. Such a system owned by the hacker is termed as a zombie system.

Phase-5:
Covering Tracks: The hackers try to hide their presence after completing above phases so that the security personnel may not be able to identify their existence. They try to remove all the traces of their attacks like modification of log files, removal of IDS Alarms which include techniques like steganography, usage of tunneling protocols etc.

<h3>Common Entry Points for Attack</h3>
<p>
Some of the commonly used entry points for an attack are:
Remote Network: This attack is from the public network commonly the internet. But organizations have employed sufficient security mechanisms like secure Firewalls, Proxy Servers and router security and VPN based security to combat these attacks.
Local Network: This type of attack uses the LAN as its access network. A LAN attack needs a physical access to the network if it is a wired network. But with increasing usage of wireless networks (WLANs), this type of attack has become a potential risk on the present day scenario.
Stolen Equipment: This type of attack is a physical attack that includes stealing personal devices like Laptops, Mobiles etc.
Social Engineering: This attack checks the integrity of an employee in the organization by using telephonic or face to face communication. Generally asking information from a helpdesk in an organization.
Physical Entry: This type of attack compromises the physical premises as the attacker installs viruses, Trojans or even key loggers to tap the sensitive information by installing some physical devices. This also can be sometimes stealing of confidential documents available openly in the office premises.

<h3>Testing Types</h3>
<p>
There are two types of testing mechanisms available for ethical hackers to provide cyber security. These are Security test and Penetration Test. For performing these tests, the Ethical Hacker follows three different approaches.
These are:
Black Box Approach: This is the actual approach to attack an organization followed by the Hackers. The Ethical hackers have to use this method for analyzing the actual attack scenario from the remote attackers outside the organization as there is no information about the internal topology of the infrastructure under target. One disadvantage in this method is that it takes abnormally long time and also very expensive.
White Box Approach: This approach is usually employed by an attacker who may be sometimes even a network administrator himself thus avoiding all the preliminary phases of attacks like reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access etc. as he knows the topology of the infrastructure. This is much faster and simple but doesn’t cover the scenarios of Black Box approach. Many Security audits are done on this approach only to avoid additional cost and time involved in the audit.
Gray Box Approach: This approach is usually an insider attack approach from other than a network administrator. These attackers are employees or contractors within the organization who may surpass the privilege levels given to them for posing an attack. The ethical hacker has to test the privilege levels given to each of these employees or contractors for avoiding threat to the organization.

<h3>Security Audits</h3>
<p>
These are the essential audits required for ensuring cyber security within an organizational framework.
The following steps are to be followed for conducting Security Audits:
i.	Requirements are to be gathered from the client (organization) for conducting security tests.
ii.	Making Agreement with the Client for running these tests.
iii.	Organize a team for ethical hacking with schedule of tasks
iv.	Implement various tests
v.	Analyze the test results and prepare a security report on this.
vi.	Submitting security flaws as a report to the client.
